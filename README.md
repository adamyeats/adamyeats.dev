# adamyeats.dev

My personal website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build).

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE:** This is a work in progress. I'm building this site in public, so you can see how I work and how I build things. At the moment, very basic things like mobile responsiveness are not implemented.

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
